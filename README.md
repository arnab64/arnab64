### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Arnab!

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer @eBaySearch. I solve product problems in ranking, advertising, monetization using ML and AI.   

For fun, Iâ€™m currently working on building a bunch of open-source AI toolkits. Apart from that, I am interested in AI research, and I'm especially focused on building end products using ML and AI. eCommerce is my domain of expertise, and a field I personally like, but *Gaming, Art and Linguistics* is what I am interested in building AI products for.
