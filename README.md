### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Arnab!

I'm a Data Scientist (previously Machine Learning Engineer) at eBay Inc. I'm in the Search Science group and I solve product problems in search ranking, advertising, ads monetization using ML and AI. I'm currently involved with Motion Tracking and Pose Estimation for Animation/VFX, and that is something I enjoy rather than doing boring stuff for big companies in a confined environment.

I consider myself more of an ML engineer and less of a scientist. Check out a few open-source AI toolkits I work on or fun.
