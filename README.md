### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**arnab64/arnab64** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building a bunch of open-source AI toolkits
- [fling](https://github.com/fastboardAI/fling) : Linguistic feature extraction for domain specific tasks 
- [stella](https://github.com/fastboardAI/stella) : Your personal AI fashionista 
- [fastSearch]() : AI based search framework for ecommerce and travel applications
- [badPlanet]() : Classic Asteroids renewed.

 I will be teaching Introduction to Machine Learning Systems at Tezpur University, Spring 2021.
