### Hi there 👋, I'm Arnab!

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer @eBaySearch. I solve research problems in ranking, advertising, monetization.   

For fun, I’m currently working on building a bunch of open-source AI toolkits. Apart from that, I am interested in AI research and especially building systems using ML. I am interested in applying AI in the field of finance, music, art, and in general building tools to make usage of AI easier for the general public.
